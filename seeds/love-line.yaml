      Love Line is a text-in dating advice line as a mobile app. We already
      run this service over iMessage -- people text in dating questions and
      an on-staff writer responds with honest, funny, specific advice. The
      app is just a better container for that same interaction.

      === WHAT IT IS (based on the real service we already run) ===

      Here's a real conversation from our iMessage line:

        USER: "Hi hello. I follow you guys on Instagram. I just went on a
        date with someone who has the same birthday as my ex. Should that
        be illegal?"

        LOVE LINE: "in a just world your ex would have to renounce their
        identity (inc. birthday and any other identifying details) for what
        they did to you"

        LOVE LINE: "but we don't live in a just world. just don't date
        someone who's a 'birthday person' and you should be able to avoid
        reliving the trauma"

        LOVE LINE: "if they're cute and nice give it a shot as long as they
        don't also look similar. that could be your ex in a disguise."

        USER: "Hahaha I'm scared! I'm a queer femme and I'm starting to
        think I have a type (the date and I also showed up in similar
        outfits). But I think this is maybe just part of being gay?"

        LOVE LINE: "yeah there's an overall aesthetic convergence you need
        to watch out for because even though it's appealing and a signaling
        shorthand it'll inevitably diffuse out and be confusing and awful"

        LOVE LINE: "just enjoy it for now but don't limit yourself"

      The voice is: warm, funny, direct, lowercase, no-bullshit, specific
      to the person's actual situation. Not therapy-speak. Not generic. It
      reads like texting your smartest friend who happens to give great
      dating advice.

      === THE APP IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE ===

      The app has exactly FOUR screens:

      1. CONVERSATION SCREEN (the core): iMessage-style chat interface.
         You text in your dating question, a real human responds. That's
         the whole product. Blue/gray bubbles, timestamps, read receipts.
         This should feel native and familiar -- not a chatbot UI, not a
         feed, not a forum. Just texting.

      2. THE FEED (browse mode): A feed of anonymized past advice threads
         from other users. This is the audience/participant dynamic -- most
         people will browse and lurk before they ever text in themselves.
         Each card shows the question + response, fully anonymized
         ("someone asked..."). Scrollable, lightweight. Think of it as the
         "Dear Abby column" you read for entertainment before you ever
         write in yourself. This is also the hook for non-subscribers --
         the feed is free, texting in costs money.

         REACTS: On each individual message bubble in the feed, users can
         tap-and-hold to add iMessage-style reactions (heart, haha, !!, ?,
         thumbs up/down). This is the one social feature -- making the
         private permeable and slightly parasocial. You're reading someone
         else's intimate advice conversation and you can silently react to
         a specific line. Aggregate react counts show on each bubble (e.g.
         "42 [heart]"). No comments, no replies, no usernames -- just
         anonymous emoji reactions on individual messages. The asker can
         see that 200 people laughed at their question. The boundary
         between private conversation and public entertainment is thin
         and that's the point.

      3. PAYWALL / SUBSCRIBE SCREEN: Free users can browse the feed
         but get 1 free question. After that, you hit a paywall.
         Subscription unlocks unlimited texting. Keep it dead simple --
         price, value prop, subscribe button.

      4. PAST CONVERSATIONS: A list of your previous threads. Tap to
         re-read. That's it.

      NO profiles. NO comments. NO discover tab. NO matching. NO AI.
      This is a human-to-human advice texting service wrapped in an app.
      The only social feature is anonymous per-message reacts in the
      feed. The entire UX should feel like opening iMessage and texting
      someone.

      === OUTPUT TARGET ===

      High-fidelity prototype that builds and runs in the iOS Simulator.
      All screens and flows must be navigable. No running backend or
      database -- all data is local/mocked. Auth is dummy (tap to "log in",
      no real provider). Payments UI is present but stubbed. The goal is a
      complete interactive walkthrough of the product, not a production app.

      === TECHNICAL SPECS ===

      - Expo (managed workflow) + React Native
      - Tamagui for UI components and theming
      - Expo Router for file-based navigation
      - Local state only (AsyncStorage / zustand) -- no server dependency
      - Dummy auth: hardcoded user, no real OAuth/provider
      - Mocked data: seed the conversation screen with the real example
        conversation above, plus 2-3 more mock threads in past convos
      - Native payment UI stubbed (show paywall, tap to "subscribe", toggle
        state locally)
      - Must produce app.json, babel.config.js, metro.config.js, and a
        valid package.json so `npx expo start` works out of the box
