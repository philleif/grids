      PROGRAM: oh hi calling cardz -- printable flirting card templates for a
      DIY dating app craft event in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (Wednesday 2/11,
      Valentine's week 2025).

      === WHO IS oh hi ===

      oh hi (https://ohhi.dating) is a DIY dating app for intentional singles,
      currently live in NYC with ~700 users. It is NOT a better dating app --
      it's a different kind of social experience. Think: the indie record label
      to Big Dating's major labels. Specifically the Factory Records model --
      consistent, cool, present. The brand has been described as "punk rock"
      enough for that to mean something.

      Tagline energy: "Sick of Big Dating? So are we."

      Core pillars: (1) Putting yourself out there / showing up -- participation
      over algorithms. (2) Advice, support, singles solidarity. (3) Culture and
      creativity -- zines, whimsy, editorial voice. (4) DIY community -- "we can
      make this whatever we want."

      Key product features: Personal ads (text and video, constraint-driven
      self-expression), weekly quiz-based matches, group chat ("The Lobby"),
      Love Line dating advice, IRL event calendar, and an avatar system with
      customizable rat characters wearing hats (the mascot is a little rat).

      Brand voice: Witty, warm, direct, irreverent. Reads like a smart friend
      texting you, not a corporation. Anti-corporate, anti-VC, anti-algorithm.
      NYC-native (Gawker-era sensibility, Hell Gate / Blackbird Spyplane reader
      energy). Zine energy, lo-fi DIY aesthetic. Profane but warm -- "hockey stick
      it up yours, pal!" Never mean, always fun. Emoji-forward, playful.
      Lowercase-casual.

      Design aesthetic: Yellow brand color, time-based gradients, bold playful
      typography, rat mascot with customizable hats/fur/aura. Lo-fi zine-inspired
      collateral alongside more polished editorial pieces.

      IRL presence: oh hi has a significant offline-first strategy -- zines
      (personals, poetry, field guides), personal ad boards in bars (Black Rabbit,
      Desperate Losers), flyering and park tabling, events (salon cuts, comedy,
      zine launches, video personals shoots), "kits" with tappable bands and
      sticker QR codes. The physical artifacts feed the digital product.

      Audience: Older millennials (who remember Gawker) and younger Gen-Z women.
      Singles in NYC who are culturally engaged, slightly cynical about apps,
      crave community. People who read Hell Gate, Blackbird Spyplane, Deez Links,
      Ask Polly.

      === THE EVENT ===

      "If Hinge is the new LinkedIn, then we need to get American Psycho (but
      DIY instead of M&A). But how, you ask? We're getting together and making
      acquaintance/calling/kissing/visiting cards (like a business card, but for
      flirting) in Greenpoint on Wednesday, 2/11.

      Whether you're gearing up for V-Day or just braving the cold, cutie-filled
      streets of New York day-to-day, you can keep one tucked snugly in your
      jacket to pass along instead of settling for playing eye tag on the subway.

      Happy crafting, crushes."

      This is a hands-on craft event. Attendees show up, sit down, and make
      their own cards using templates, stamps, markers, stickers. The templates
      we produce are the starting point -- they need to be customizable, writable,
      stampable, not precious. The vibe is community craft night, not design
      studio. Think zine fairs, not Kinko's.

      === WHAT WE'RE BUILDING ===

      A set of printable card templates (standard business card size, 3.5x2")
      that event attendees will customize by hand at the event and carry with
      them afterward. The templates must work as both:
      - Pre-printed blanks to fill in with markers/stamps at the event
      - Digital files someone could customize + print at home

      FORMAT: Templates are SVG with embedded raster elements. Pure vector SVG
      will NOT have the fidelity we need -- the zine/DIY aesthetic demands
      scanned textures, photocopied grain, hand-drawn illustrations, and found
      imagery. The pipeline: scan or source reference graphics -> ImageMagick
      processing (knock out to black, threshold, levels, preserve detail) ->
      embed as high-res raster elements within the SVG structure. This gives
      us the best of both worlds: scalable layout/typography in vector, plus
      authentic analog texture from raster. Think of each card as a mixed-media
      collage -- vector text frames and rules, raster textures and illustrations.
      Final export to PDF embeds everything at print resolution (300dpi min).

      === DESIGN DIRECTION ===

      DIY/zine aesthetic meets Victorian calling card tradition. The moodboard
      (Pinterest: oh-hi-calling-cardz) includes:
      - Handwritten notes on heart-shaped doilies ("i think you're mad cute")
      - Lace heart doilies, vintage valentine typography
      - Cut-and-paste collage, xerox textures, risograph grain
      - Victorian ornate borders recontextualized with subversive content
      - Rubber stamp textures, typewriter fonts mixed with ornate script
      - Torn paper edges, doodle margins, notebook paper

      NOT polished corporate. NOT generic Canva. NOT Hinge's beige minimalism.
      Reference the American Psycho business card scene but make it tender and
      funny instead of psychotic -- the obsessive attention to paper stock and
      font choice, but in service of "do you think i'm cute? check yes or no."

      The cards should feel like they came from a zine distro table or a
      community bulletin board, not a design agency. They should look like
      something you'd find tucked into a used paperback at a Greenpoint bookshop.

      === CONTENT FIELDS ===

      Each card template needs space for:
      - A name or alias (can be playful/anonymous -- "your subway crush",
        "the one with the tote bag", a first name, whatever)
      - A flirty tagline, pickup line, or personal ad snippet
        (samples: "i think you're mad cute", "looking for someone to split
        a bodega sandwich with", "my rat says we'd be compatible")
      - Contact: oh hi username, instagram handle, phone number, or just vibes
      - Optional: a small illustration slot -- rat mascot, heart, star, lips,
        a tiny drawing. The oh hi rat should be available as a stamp option.
      - Small "oh hi" wordmark or URL -- subtle, not dominant. This is a
        calling card, not an ad. But people should know where it came from.

      === VARIANTS (at least 6 templates) ===

      1. "the classic" -- Victorian calling card layout. Ornate border, centered
         script text, formal structure -- but the content is about crushes.
         Think: "Ms. [Your Name] requests the pleasure of your company for
         a coffee at the weird place on Manhattan Ave."

      2. "the personal ad" -- Newspaper classifieds style. Columnar layout,
         small type, abbreviations (SWF seeks...), maybe a tiny clip-art heart.
         References oh hi's actual personal ads feature. Feels like ripping
         something out of the Village Voice circa 1997.

      3. "the love note" -- Handwritten feel. Notebook paper lines or torn
         edges, doodle margins, "check yes or no" checkbox energy. The kind
         of note you'd pass in class. Unfolded and creased.

      4. "the american psycho" -- The parody template. Bone white. Silian Rail
         font. "That subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it."
         But the text says things like "i like your vibe" and "let's get a
         beer?" Obsessive production value in service of being casual.

      5. "the zine" -- Xerox/risograph aesthetic. Cut-and-paste collage, ransom
         note lettering mixed with typed text, photocopied texture. Feels like
         a page torn from an oh hi zine. High-contrast B&W friendly.

      6. "the valentine" -- Heart doily border, red + pink palette, retro cute
         Valentines aesthetic. "be mine" energy but for adults who are self-aware
         about it. Candy hearts, lace, cursive, but with a wink.

      Bonus if there's room:
      7. "the rat" -- Built around the oh hi rat mascot. The rat delivers
         your message. Cute, weird, memorable.
      8. "the minimalist" -- For people who think all the above is too much.
         Clean, one line of text, lots of white space. Still warm.

      === PRODUCTION SPECS ===

      - Standard business card: 3.5 x 2 inches (252 x 144 pt)
      - Printable on standard home printers (letter/A4, 8-up imposition)
      - Source format: SVG with embedded raster elements (base64 PNG or
        linked high-res assets). Vector for layout/type, raster for textures
        and illustrations.
      - Raster pipeline: scan/source -> ImageMagick (convert -threshold,
        -level, -negate, -morphology for cleanup) -> knock out to black on
        transparent -> embed in SVG at 300dpi equivalent resolution
      - PDF export with trim marks, crop marks, embedded fonts and images
      - MUST work in black & white -- not everyone has color printers, and
        xerox/riso reproduction is part of the aesthetic. The raster elements
        should already be 1-bit or high-contrast grayscale.
      - High contrast designs that survive bad photocopying
      - Generous margins for hand-cutting with scissors (no precision needed)
      - Bleed: 0.125" on all sides (standard)
      - Paper stock suggestions for the event: French Paper Pop-Tone (fun
        colors, good weight), Neenah Classic Crest, or whatever cardstock
        you can grab at the bodega. Nothing precious.
      - Templates should have clearly marked "write here" zones for the
        hand-customization at the event

      === CULTURAL GROUNDING ===

      The history of the calling card matters here. Victorian "acquaintance
      cards" and "escort cards" were literally the original flirting technology
      -- you'd leave one at someone's house with elaborate coded corner-folds
      meaning "I'm interested" or "I'll call again." The Victorians also had
      "kissing cards" with printed flirtations. This event reclaims that
      tradition for a dating app that believes romance should be analog,
      personal, and a little weird.

      oh hi's whole thesis is that the best dating experiences are participatory
      and cultural, not algorithmic. Making a physical card to hand to a crush
      is the ultimate expression of that -- you're putting yourself out there
      with your hands, not swiping. The cards should feel like artifacts of
      genuine human effort, not advertisements for an app.

      The flywheel: physical artifacts (cards) drive awareness of the digital
      product (app). Someone gets a card, sees "oh hi" on it, looks it up.
      But the card itself is the experience -- the app is just where you go next.

      === DELIVERABLES ===

      1. SVG+raster templates (editable, one per variant) -- vector layout
         with embedded raster textures/illustrations processed via ImageMagick
      2. High-res raster asset library (scanned/processed textures, borders,
         illustrations as individual PNGs, knocked out to black on transparent)
      3. Imposed PDF sheets (8-up on letter, print-ready, trim marks, all
         raster elements embedded at 300dpi)
      4. A one-page event style guide (so attendees understand the vibe,
         the content suggestions, the spirit of the thing)
      5. Variant previews showing each template filled with sample content
         that captures oh hi's voice
      6. ImageMagick processing recipes for each raster element (so the
         pipeline is reproducible and new source material can be added)
